README.md: Importing & Securing Data in ServiceNow
Overview

This guide explains best practices and steps for importing data into ServiceNow while ensuring data security and compliance.

Features

Import data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, XML, JDBC, LDAP, HTTP, FTP)

Use Import Sets and Transform Maps for data mapping

Secure sensitive and encrypted fields

Support for bulk imports and automation

Best Practices

Import data on each instance separately

Commit resources to ensure data cleanliness

Test the quality of production data early

Use coalesce fields to prevent duplicate records

Plan for data security and compliance throughout the process

Importing Data Steps

Create a Data Source
Define the data source (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Load Data into Staging Table
Use Import Sets to stage incoming data.

Create a Transform Map
Map fields from the import set to target ServiceNow tables.

Auto Map Matching Fields
Use auto-mapping or Mapping Assist to align fields.

Set Field Values (Optional)
Use Transform Map scripts to set or modify field values during import.

Run or Schedule Import
Execute or schedule the import job as needed.

Securing Sensitive Data

Use ServiceNow’s built-in encryption for sensitive fields.

Note: Import Sets cannot add data directly to encrypted fields; encrypted data must be handled via foreground scripts with proper user context.

Always review and configure access controls (ACLs) on sensitive tables and fields.

Supported File Types

CSV

Excel

XML

JSON (for some integrations)

Others (via connectors)

Troubleshooting

If importing encrypted fields, data may not be stored as encrypted unless handled with proper scripting and user context.

For large imports, use bulk tools or automation (e.g., SNulk).

Example: Basic Import Set Workflow

text
1. Create Data Source (CSV)
2. Load data into staging table (Import Set)
3. Create Transform Map (map fields)
4. Run Transform Map to populate target table
5. Verify data and security settings
Security Note:
Always follow your organization’s compliance and privacy requirements when importing and handling sensitive data in ServiceNow.

For advanced use cases (automation, bulk import, or API integration), see SNulk and related tools.
